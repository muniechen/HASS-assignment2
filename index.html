    <p>This is a visualization that reflects the banned pesticides notified for export from the European onion in 2018. Different active ingredients are represented by different colors. The collocations are represented by colored sections.</p>

    <p>This visualization utilizes exquisite colors and illustrations to create a visually pleasant experience, allowing viewers to quickly understand the types of countries exporting different types of ingredients through the illustrations. In the diagram above, we observe that Paraquat, produced by Syngenta, represents more than a quarter of European exports of banned pesticides. Colors donâ€™t hold special meanings; they're simply useful for tracking the flow of a particular product.</p>
    <p>Although the design is beautiful, there are still some shortcomings:</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Idiom">
    <h3>Idiom:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>This idiom uses different types of colors, but the colors don't have any meaning, making it visually overwhelming. As a result, too many colors can cause visual fatigue and make it easier to get confused by the information emphasized by the colors.
        </li>
        <li>The idiom employs a very novel way of connecting elements, but it lacks practicality. It is difficult to quickly find the other end of a connection for one endpoint.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Data:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The text in the visualization is too small, making it difficult to identify the exporting country without careful observation (it may be mistaken for another country). Since the text is very small, it is almost impossible to recognize the relationship between the exporting country, active ingredients, and importing country.</p>
        <li>The contents below are too small and can easily be ignored.</p>
    </ol>
    <h3>Improvement:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The colors could be made more distinct to facilitate linking the exporting country to the importing country.</li>
        <li>Enlarge text in the visualizaion.</li>
    </ol>

    <P>This visualization maps the depositor's IP portfolios to existing SME technology needs.<p><a href="https://www.martingrandjean.ch/europe-banned-pesticides/">source</a></p></P>

    <p>The visualization uses different colors to represent several SME technologies and is presented in a circular form.</p>
    <p>However, it still has some shortcomings in idiom and data.</p>
    <h3>Idiom:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The visualization uses different colored lines to represent various fields, each linking to different SME technologies.</li>
        <li>The texts representing SME technologies are too small, making it very hard to see each technology's name and understand the relationship between fields and technologies.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Data:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The lines are too thin, making it difficult to connect the fields and SME technologies.</li>
        <li>The number of curved lines in the visualization is excessive, resulting in complexity.</li>
        <li>The font size of state abbreviations is too small, and there is too much variation in color, making it difficult for people to focus on them.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Improvement:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Changing to a square table and increasing the line width would be more appropriate for this case.</li>
        <li>Enlarge the SEM and the texts representing the fields.</li>
        <li>Utilize the legends to explain the meanings of the colors and texts.</li>
    </ol>
